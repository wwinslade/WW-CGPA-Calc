# WW-CGPA-Calc
 
Dead simple CGPA calculator. Simply compile and call with a .txt file in a format where you list each courses hours followed by the grade you got in the class. Returns total hours, total grade points, and GPA to the 2nd decimal place.
`./a.out grades_file.txt`

grades_file.txt should look something like either:
`2 A-`
or
`2
a-`
